# Binance-Trade-Anomaly-Detection
This project provides a script for detecting anomalies in trade volumes on Binance, using historical trade data for a specified trading pair. The script fetches historical trades from Binanceâ€™s public API and analyzes trade volumes, highlighting any trades that fall outside a given threshold (based on standard deviation).
